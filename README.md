MiSTer.ini is the file that contains low level settings for MiSTer FPGA. This repository contains a collection of INI files for various MiSTer Addons products: IO Analog, IO Direct, and MiSTercade. 
These INIs may not be up to date and may lack newer settings from the main MiSTer.ini from the official MiSTer Github repository.
While these INI files should be enough to get you up and running, it's important that you take time to further customize the INI files to your specific setup.
Please create a Github Issue if you find problems with these files.

Love,
Porkchop Express
