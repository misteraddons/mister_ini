This section is for IO Direct which uses a full-range 24-bit HDMI DAC to produce pristine and accurate 24-bit RGB video.

Note that you can't use HDMI output simultaneously when you use Direct Video.

YPbPr requires the Sync-on-green switch set to the ON position.

VGA output is experimental. Most cores work great. Some cores don't have the scandoubler included due to space constraints (PSX, and N64). Still working on the native 480p cores (memtest, ao486, etc.) 

IO Direct requires a Saturn to HD15 cable, only offered on misteraddons.com
