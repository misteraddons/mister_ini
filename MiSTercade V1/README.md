MiSTercade is a love letter that bridges the magic of MiSTer with JAMMA arcade cabinets. These INI files option the basic setups for almost all cabinet types.

MiSTer doesn't offer an easy way to rotate analog video. Like original arcade PCBs, the monitor was intended to be rotated within the cabinet for each game.

You can try enabling vga_scaler and using the built-in core rotation features if you'd like.
